excerpt: — but now I want to be.
---

If you’re here reading this, chances are you care enough about me to want to understand more than just the surface. So, maybe you already know parts of who I am—or maybe you don’t. Either way, as June begins, I want to talk about something I’ve rarely shared: being gay.

I don’t often write about myself, especially not about my sexuality. I’ve always considered it a “sensitive” topic—likely shaped by how I was raised and the expectations I grew up with.

**But today, I want to make a change.**

### **Why now?**

Being gay isn’t the problem—not here, not in the U.S., and certainly not in the eyes of those who matter.

The real issue has been my mindset: the anxiety, the second-guessing, the fear of how people might interpret it, or whether colleagues might see me differently. For too long, I’ve let that fear direct my behavior. I’ve poured energy into trying to control how I’m perceived instead of embracing who I am.

Lately, I’ve started asking myself: *Why don’t I feel proud? Why do I move through life cautiously—around everything, like a thief?*

Today, I want that to change.

I want to love myself a little more. I want to let go of the belief that other people’s perceptions define my worth. I want to stop avoiding simple questions like “What did you do this weekend?” just because I spent time with my boyfriend. (Even now, writing that word—*boyfriend*—feels like a risk. But it’s the truth.)

Instead of saying “I’m single” out of habit or fear, whenever people ask, I’ll say, “I have a boyfriend”—openly, honestly, and ready to talk more if others are curious.

This is a decision I’m making today. It won’t be perfect. It’ll take time. But I’m done postponing it.

It’s June. It’s Pride Month 🏳️‍🌈. And it’s time for me to step out of the closet—not with a grand announcement, but with quiet, daily acts of courage.

To live more fully. To speak more freely. 

To be more me.
