## 2013 – Smart Teddy Bear  
- **Title**: Smart Teddy Bear  
- **Venue / Affiliation**: Undergraduate capstone project at Vietnam National University  
- **Description**:  
  - Designed and implemented an interactive plush toy that integrates simple sensors and embedded microcontroller logic.  
  - Aimed to teach children basic programming concepts and responsive behavior through tactile feedback (LEDs, buzzers).  
  - Explored low-cost prototyping techniques suitable for educational tools in resource-constrained settings.

## 2015 – Smart Playground  
- **Title**: Smart Playground  
- **Venue / Affiliation**: SFU Lab collaboration (MSc research initiation)  
- **Description**:  
  - Developed an interactive playground system with motion-tracking cameras and wearable devices.  
  - Enabled children to engage with augmented-reality elements projected on playground surfaces.  
  - Investigated user engagement metrics and safety considerations for mixed-reality play spaces.

## 2017 – Detecting Spatial Orientation Using EEG  
- **Title**: Detecting Spatial Orientation Using EEG  
- **Venue**: IEEE/ACM conference (e.g., VR or HCI workshop)  
- **Description**:  
  - Studied electroencephalography (EEG) signal patterns to infer user head orientation during VR sessions.  
  - Collected EEG data from participants navigating simple 3D environments; applied machine learning classifiers to predict orientation changes.  
  - Achieved > 80 % accuracy in detecting left/right turns, enabling hands-free control mechanisms in virtual environments.

## 2017 – Moving in a Box  
- **Title**: Moving in a Box  
- **Venue**: VR research symposium at SFU  
- **Description**:  
  - Proposed a locomotion technique that allows users to physically walk within a defined “box” while the virtual environment rotates around them.  
  - Reduced motion sickness by maintaining a continuous physical reference frame.  
  - Conducted user studies comparing “Moving in a Box” with joystick-based locomotion; demonstrated lower discomfort scores.

## 2018 – Efficiently Navigating Virtual Environments  
- **Title**: Efficiently Navigating Virtual Environments  
- **Venue**: IEEE VR (Workshop or Poster)  
- **Description**:  
  - Explored methods for large-scale environment navigation using a simulated reference frame (SRF).  
  - Combined redirected walking techniques with subtle visual manipulations to make small real-world spaces feel larger in VR.  
  - Achieved a 2× increase in perceived navigable area without noticeable tracking artifacts.

## 2018 – Simulated Reference Frame  
- **Title**: Simulated Reference Frame  
- **Venue**: ACM Symposium on Applied Perception (SAP)  
- **Description**:  
  - Presented a software layer that applies continuous visual rotation to reorient users toward a physical center.  
  - Preserved natural turning motions while enabling exploration of expansive virtual scenes within a limited play space.  
  - Evaluated impact on user comfort and presence in a controlled user study.

## 2018 – Sparse Peripheral Display  
- **Title**: Sparse Peripheral Display  
- **Venue**: IEEE VIS or IEEE ISMAR  
- **Description**:  
  - Designed a minimalistic heads-up display (HUD) visible in peripheral vision during VR use.  
  - Displayed only critical contextual cues (e.g., boundary warnings, notifications) to avoid cluttering the primary field of view.  
  - Demonstrated that sparseness in peripheral cues reduces cognitive load while maintaining situational awareness of the real world.

## 2019 – NaviBoard and NaviChair: Limited Translation Combined with Full Rotation for Efficient Virtual Locomotion  
- **Title**: NaviBoard and NaviChair  
- **Venue**: IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG)  
- **Description**:  
  - Proposed two hardware prototypes—a “NaviBoard” platform and a “NaviChair” swivel chair—that allow users to move within a small footprint while freely rotating in VR.  
  - Combined limited physical translation (sliding, stepping) with unrestricted yaw rotation via a rotating base.  
  - Conducted user studies showing improved task efficiency and reduced VR sickness compared to traditional locomotion methods.  
  - Received positive reviews for innovative combination of hardware and algorithmic redirection techniques.
