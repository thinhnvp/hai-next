# Music & Art

## Music
- **General Listening Habits**  
  - Does not follow specific genres closely; uses music primarily for background while coding or during runs.
  - Prefers instrumental playlists (lo-fi, ambient) to maintain focus.
- **Cultural Fusion**  
  - Though living abroad, seeks out Vietnamese music to maintain a sense of home.
  - Occasionally attends live performances at local Vietnamese cultural events in Seattle.

## Art & Creative Expression
- **Visual Art**  
  - Appreciates minimalist design—favored art exhibitions with clean, functional aesthetics (e.g., mid-century modern, Scandinavian influences).
  - Collects digital prints for home office, often featuring nature scenes reminiscent of Đà Lạt or Pacific Northwest forests.
- **Photography**  
  - Casual photographer during travels—focuses on landscapes and candid street scenes.
  - Edits photos in Lightroom to develop an eye for composition, which informs blog illustrations.
- **Writing as Art**  
  - Treats blog essays on Tedditory’s Takeaways as a form of creative expression—uses metaphors and narrative arcs inspired by classical Vietnamese storytelling.
