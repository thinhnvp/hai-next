# Weekend Routines

## Saturday
1. **Morning Coffee**  
   - Goes for some favorite coffees.
   - Uses this time as quality time with his partner.  

2. **Community Time**  
   - Visits Vietnamese restaurants or cafés to catch up with nearby Vietnamese friends.  

3. **Household Projects**  
   - Spends an hour on home maintenance or organizing the townhouse—often ties into real-estate side projects (e.g., reviewing maintenance costs, planning Airbnb updates).

4. **Reading/Writing**  
   - Blocks out 2–3 hours to draft a blog post or read a chapter of a leadership/business book.  
   - Summarizes key points in bullet lists for retention (used later in Daily Motivation journaling).

5. **Evening Relaxation & Social**  
   - Video calls with friends back in Vietnam or family to maintain cultural connection and practice Vietnamese.
   - Social drinks sometimes with friends.

## Sunday
1. **Reflection & Planning**  
   - Reviews past week’s goals: checks off completed tasks, notes carry-overs.  
   - Sets top three priorities for the upcoming week (aligned with IC5 goal and mortgage payoff timeline).

2. **Tarot & Intention Setting**  
   - Conducts a three-card draw for weekly guidance—cards chosen at random, interpreted without bias from prior readings.  
   - Writes a short note on how to apply insights to upcoming challenges (e.g., “be bold in asking for feedback,” “focus on uncertainty in career transitions”).

3. **Skill-Building Session**  
   - 30–45 minutes dedicated to coding practice (system design questions for IC5 prep) or ML basics for ranking systems.  
   - Alternatively listens to an English podcast focused on leadership or data science.

4. **Rest & Recreation**  
   - Leisure time: watches a tech documentary or reads fiction in Vietnamese for mental reset.  
   - Ensures at least 7–8 hours of sleep to recover from on-call rotations or work-related stress.
