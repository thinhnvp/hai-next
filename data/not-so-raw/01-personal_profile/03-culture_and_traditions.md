  - Vietnam is renowned for enjoying life and communal festivities with relatively less day-to-day pressure.  
- **Lunar New Year rituals**: Visiting both paternal and maternal sides of the family on New Year’s Day is mandatory.  

## Religious / Spiritual Beliefs

- **Regular practices**:  
  - Casual pagoda visits nearly every month (no formal planning required).

- **Special celebration foods**:  
  - Bánh tét (glutinous rice cake) is Ted’s favorite during Tết.  

## Regional Customs
- **Customs tied to hometown/region**: None specific beyond general southern-Vietnamese communal living patterns.  

## Diaspora / Adaptation
- **Living abroad (Canada, U.S.)**:  
  - Ted consistently seeks out Vietnamese restaurants and friends wherever he lives—food and community are core to preserving his identity.  
  - Maintains foreign friendships as primarily professional acquaintances, reserving his inner circle for fellow Vietnamese.  
- **Practices kept/adjusted/let go**:  
  - Always celebrates Lunar New Year even when living alone overseas.
