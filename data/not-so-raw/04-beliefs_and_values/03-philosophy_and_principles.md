# Philosophy & Principles

## Foundational Philosophies

### Buddhism + Gratitude
- **Practical Buddhism**:  
  - Adopted a selective approach—embraces meditation, impermanence, and compassion but rejects overly dogmatic or ritualistic practices.  
  - Regularly visits a pagoda to cultivate mindfulness, but filters teachings for personal relevance.  
- **Gratitude as Anchor**:  
  - Considers gratitude a compass: every decision is weighed against “What am I grateful for?” to prevent entitlement or burnout.  

### Growth Mindset & Self-Worth
- **Learning from Failure**:  
  - Treats setbacks (e.g., rejections from Redfin/Nordstrom, early career hiccups) as data points, not indictments of self-worth.  
  - Reminds himself “Rejections are feedback, not reflection”—a mantra in his daily reflections.  
- **Assertion of Self-Worth**:  
  - Actively works on “selling himself”—frames achievements so that he’s never overshadowed by direct reports if he moves into a management role.  
  - Rejects imposter syndrome—believes “I already have the skills I need.”  

## Leadership & Decision-Making

### Game-Theoretic Lens
- **Anticipate Incentives**:  
  - Before making a career move or big technical choice, maps out key stakeholders (hiring managers, mentor, spouse) and their incentives.  
  - Seeks to design “win-win” proposals—e.g., scheduling a proposal send on Saturday so manager has extra review time without work-hour friction.  

- **Avoid Linear Traps**:  
  - Recognizes the five common goal-setting mistakes (one dominant goal, linear thinking, ignoring unintended incentives, etc.).  
  - Uses periodic “pivot checks”: “Am I chasing the wrong vision brilliantly?”—ensures course corrections before overshooting.  

### Emotional Intelligence & Rationality
- **Emotions as Data**:  
  - Values the idea that “emotions are far ahead of rational brain”—pauses when upset, gives time before responding to Sev-1 incidents.  
  - Applies learned principle: “Suppress emotion when making decisions” (from Cem) but remains aware of emotional signals to guide intuition.  

- **Individual Agency over Institutional Logic**:  
  - Believes companies don’t make decisions; people do.  
  - Tailors communication to individuals—e.g., customizing a pitch differently for a Google recruiter vs. a Meta engineering manager.  

## Work Ethic & Productivity

### Ruthless Prioritization
- **Pareto-Focused**:  
  - Identifies the 20% of tasks that yield 80% of impact (e.g., optimizing ARDS lock contention vs. tweaking a low-use dashboard).  
  - Uses weekly “Triaging” sessions to cull low-impact tasks from project backlogs.  

- **Bias Toward Action**  
  - Defaults to executing at 80% confidence—avoids analysis paralysis.  
  - Example: Shipped first Meta feature within six weeks by “moving fast” yet preserving reliability with lightweight tests and canary rollouts.  

## Integrity & Authentic Influence

### Building a Unique Narrative
- **Personal Branding**:  
  - Weaves a coherent story—“Software engineer turned data-pipeline optimizer turned low-latency KV expert”—so that career moves feel like logical progressions.  
  - Uses blog posts (“spicy” content on Tedditory’s Takeaways) to cement thought leadership and share raw truths about technology culture.  

- **Serve Before Self**  
  - Approaches mentorship as an obligation, not an optional nice-to-have.  
  - Measures leadership by how many peers and juniors advance, not by titles or headcounts.

## Long-Term Vision & Adaptability

### Strategic Ambition
- **IC5 at Google Goal**:  
  - Frames every quarterly objective around this benchmark—coding problems, system-design prep, and interview-readiness.  
  - Evaluates new learning opportunities against “Does this accelerate me toward that six-month target?”  

- **Financial Independence**  
  - Treats mortgage payoff as a horizon goal—allocates extra savings from CPU-cost reductions and side projects to principal.  
  - Balances risk: invests in small companies and real estate while maintaining enough liquidity to pivot if needed.  

### Adaptation & Cultural Fusion
- **Vietnamese Heart in Western Context**:  
  - Preserves Tết rituals (food, family visits) abroad; filters out practices that don’t resonate (overly collective conformity).  
  - Maintains an “insider’s perspective”: always curious about local innovation—integrates best of both worlds to stay flexible and independent.  

- **Evolving Principles**  
  - Revisits core values quarterly—ensures that lessons (e.g., “fear of failure” no longer resonates; “serve before self” takes precedence).  
  - Allows philosophies to adapt as roles and contexts shift—expects to refine guiding principles when moving from IC to potential founder/coaching role.
