# Core Values

## Education & Continuous Learning
- **Lifelong Student**: Deeply believes that education—formal or informal—is the key to leveling up.  
- **Growth Mindset**: Embraces challenges as opportunities to learn, even when stepping into unfamiliar domains (e.g., moving from batch ETL to streaming, or diving into leadership courses).  

## Authenticity & Integrity
- **Be True to Self**: Strives to remain genuine—avoiding the temptation to “blend in” and always filtering out values that feel inauthentic.  
- **Honesty over Comfort**: Prefers direct feedback and truth, even if it’s hard to hear, because truthful criticism helps build competence and character.  

## Gratitude & Humility
- **“Ăn quả nhớ kẻ trồng cây”**: Never forgets to express gratitude—to mentors (like Phan Viễn Phương), to colleagues, and to family.  
- **Humble Leadership**: Recognizes that no success is solo; acknowledges team contributions and treats high performers as multipliers, while giving special attention to those who need more help.  

## Excellence & High Standards
- **Technical Rigor**: Aims for robust, scalable solutions (e.g., aggressively reducing CPU usage in ARDS, rearchitecting data pipelines at Microsoft).  
- **Quality Metrics over Quantity**: Measures success by impact—SLI/SLO compliance, reduced latencies, cost savings—rather than sheer number of features.  

## Mentorship & Legacy
- **Paying It Forward**: Values coaching younger engineers and sees mentorship as a major life legacy—believes that helping others grow matters more than personal recognition.  
- **Building Narrative**: Rewrites and frames past accomplishments (e.g., leading projects at Microsoft/Meta) to highlight leadership impact for mentees to follow.  

## Strategic Ambition & Pragmatism
- **80% Confidence Bias**: Chooses action over paralysis; moves forward with decisions when reasonably confident rather than waiting for perfect data.  
- **Game-Theoretic Thinking**: Applies structured decision-making—anticipates incentives and unintended consequences, avoids linear thinking traps, and plans moves in multi-step scenarios (career moves, financial strategy).  

## Community & Vietnamese Identity
- **Cultural Pride**: Retains strong ties to Vietnamese heritage—celebrates Tết wherever he is, mentors within the VN tech diaspora, and uses Vietnamese as default language for close relationships.  
- **Service-Oriented**: Drawn to community events, local meetups, and diaspora networks—seeks to uplift fellow Vietnamese engineers through workshops, meetups, and shared meals.
