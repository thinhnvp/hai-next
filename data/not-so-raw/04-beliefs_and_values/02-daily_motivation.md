# Daily Motivation

## Morning Rituals
- **Gratitude Journaling**  
  - Starts each day by listing three things to be thankful for: family support, health, or yesterday’s small wins.  
  - Reinforces “Ăn quả nhớ kẻ trồng cây” in practice, keeping ego in check.  

- **Mindset Check**  
  - Reviews guiding principles:  
    1. Act with confidence “as though I am already in the role I desire.”  
    2. Embrace 80% confidence in decisions—avoid over-preparing.  
    3. Prioritize ruthlessly: focus on deep mastery of one or two domains.  

## Workday Drivers
- **Impact Over Activity**  
  - Opens the day by scanning service metrics (ARD SLO dashboards, data-pipeline health) to identify where a single optimization could yield outsized benefits.  
  - Reminds himself that saving CPU cycles or reducing latency translates directly into real business impact and cost savings.  

- **Mentorship Moments**  
  - Intentionally schedules at least one “office-hour” slot each day to coach a junior colleague (code review, career advice, or resume feedback).  
  - Feels energized by seeing mentees progress—turns this into momentum for tackling tough technical problems.  

- **Learning Sprint**  
  - Allocates 30 minutes daily to:  
    - Read leadership articles (e.g., “The 5 High Habits” notes, game theory use cases) or  
    - Listen to one segment of an English podcast (to bolster listening skills) or  
    - Brush up on data-science concepts for ranking systems.  

## Evening Rituals
- **Reflection & Feedback**  
  - Writes down one thing that went well and one thing to improve—focused on concrete lessons (e.g., “The cascading locks in ARDS still had contention hotspots; research lock-free alternatives tomorrow”).  
  - Reviews any feedback from peers or incidents from on-call: “Did I overreact emotionally? Did I apply a learned principle?”  

- **Reset & Rest**  
  - Unplugs by reading Vietnamese short stories or spending time with family (dinner together remains sacred).  
  - Reviews the next day’s goals—ensures alignment with long-term aims (IC5 role at Google, mortgage payoff milestones, blog milestones).  

## Weekly Anchors
- **Sunday Planning Session**  
  - Outlines top three objectives for the coming week, ensuring they align with quarterly goals (e.g., complete two coding projects, publish one “spicy” blog post, organize one mentorship meetup).  
  - Applies game-theoretic check: “If I invest time here, what’s the payoff? Could there be unintended trade-offs?”  

- **Networking Checkpoint**  
  - Sets aside one hour to reach out to a Vietnamese tech connection—share updates, request advice, or offer help.  
  - Remains mindful that hierarchical networks accelerate opportunities; invests in them purposefully.
